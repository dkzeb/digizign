Slide Storage

### Features ###

This is basically just a stub readme file to keep the directory structure as needed.
Anyways - you need a /storage/slides directory in your project root (next to the server and client folders)
as this is where the system will save slide images as they are uploaded

At some point im gonna' change it so that this directory will get created automagically
